 In this analysis, a classification experiment was conducted on the Bank Marketing dataset, aiming to predict whether a client subscribes to a term deposit. The dataset contains various features related to bank clients, such as age, job type, marital status, education level, and more. The Pycaret library was utilized for streamlined model building, comparison, and interpretation. The experiment involved preprocessing steps, the creation of various machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and ensemble methods. The best-performing models were selected based on recall, and their performance was visualized using different plots. The final model, an AdaBoost Classifier, was saved, and its interpretation was analyzed. Additionally, a Java code snippet representing a decision tree model was generated. The results showcase the Pycaret library's capability for efficient and effective machine learning experimentation and model deployment.
